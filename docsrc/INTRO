#@[Intro] Ifkit
#
# Ifkit, or Interface Foundation Kit, is a set of convenience mixins for your
# everyday SASS needs.  We've been making the same classes for almost every
# project we do, so we're moving to standardize that set of controls.
#
# ### Requirements
#
# Ifkit requires [Sass][sass] and [Compass][comp]. Some Ifkit mixins need Sass
# 3.2+ to function (they're marked as such in this documentation), while most
# will work with any version of Sass.
#
# ### How to use
#
# Add the [Ifkit stylesheets][sheets] into your project. The recommended usage
# is to put `ifkit/` into your project's Sass directory
# (`vendor/assets/stylesheets/` in Rails).
#
# ### Why Ifkit?
#
# Ifkit aims to be a collection of self-contained building blocks of common
# interface patterns. It is not a CSS framework like Bootstrap and such.
#
# ### Sass 3.2 notes
#
# Some mixins may need Sass 3.2+ (specifically the media queries). This is
# to support mixins that can have content blocks (`eg, +if-retina { ... }`).
#
# If you arre using Ruby + Bundler, simply update your Gemfile to use a
# prerelease version:
#
#     gem 'sass', '~> 3.2.0.alpha'
#
# Or if you don't use Bundler, install it with `gem install sass --pre`.
